Since releasing this repository, we have got several inquiries about how to draw the figures in the paper.
To help those struggling with the visualization, we decide to release the reference code.

Please note that the code in this directory (swad/tools) is provided for reference purpose only.
That is, they may not be executable independently, and the default options may differ from the options used to create the paper figures.
